In this part, we will learn what containers are and do a deep dive on how they can be utilized in web development. With containers we will also learn a completely new viewpoint for web development outside of the "backend" and "frontend" that we are familiar with.

We will utilize containers to create immutable execution environments for our Node.js and React projects. Containers also make it easy to include multiple services with our projects. With the flexibility we will explore and experiment with multiple different and popular tools by utilizing containers.
